Asteroid Radar is an app to view the asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth, you can view all the detected asteroids in a period of time, their data (Size, velocity, distance to Earth) and if they are potentially hazardous.

The app is consists of two screens: A Main screen with a list of all the detected asteroids and a Details screen that is going to display the data of that asteroid once itÂ´s selected in the Main screen list. The main screen will also show the NASA image of the day to make the app more striking.
